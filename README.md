Simple Python calendar
======================

This is a simple iCal-calendar in Python.

Supported:

- viewing iCal calendars
- adding and editing events
- colored categories

Not supported and not planned:

- Free/Busy
- CalDAV
- email integration

I'm working on/thinking about:

- alarms (for v1.0)
- minimal subaspects of CalDAV (for v1.x)

Hopefully works:

- timezones
